# CTRGJulia

We propose a modified form of a tensor renormalization group algorithm for evaluating partition
functions of classical statistical mechanical models on 2D lattices. This algorithm coarse-grains
only the rows and columns of the lattice adjacent to a single core tensor at each step, such that
the lattice size shrinks linearly with the number of coarse-graining steps as opposed to shrinking
exponentially as in the usual tensor renormalization group (TRG).
